Feature: Do Some things
In order to be productive
As an emacs evil user
I want to change multiple parts of the buffer at once

Scenario: Do Something
  Given I have "something"
  When I have "something"
  Then I should have "something"
  And I should have "something"
  But I should not have "something"
